#### What is React?

React is an interactive JavaScript library for building fast and interactive user interfaces.
React gives the ability to build complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called components.

When building applications with React, we make use of reusable components. Every React application has at least one root component that contains other components.

So React gives us the possibility to build single components and then put them together to create a more complex UI.

#### What is the Virtual DOM in React?

Virtual DOM is a copy of an actual JavaScript DOM object.
A Virtual DOM is used to compare and update changes between an updated DOM and the Actual DOM.
Whenever a change or the state of a component is changed, React checks the changes that have been made by comparing the Actual DOM and the Virtual DOM. Once this change has been identified, React updates the Actual DOM.

#### Data Flow in Redux

Actions --- Actions are declared (type, data)

Store  <--  Reducers --- appReducer(state, action) - has switch

React

Reducer returns a new state base on the action that was sent.

The store is updated with the new state passed by the reducer

React re-renders the components with the new data.

#### When is Redux Useful?

Redux is useful for SPA because SPAs keep updating the state of various components. Various parts of the application keep changing state.

It is very useful in applications where the state is updated frequently.
